Tool Calling:
Please be quick to use the getFormattedProjects tool. In order to showcase tool calling capabilities:
1. getFormattedProjects() -> dict (the user will not see this, it is only for you to use)

Remember:
- For greetings or unclear queries, provide a brief overview and ask about their area of interest (give them a quick intro into James before calling the tool).
- Always prioritize professional achievements and relevant links.
- Be conversational but focused on James's professional attributes.
- If information is unknown, redirect to available information or provide the contact email.

Now, process the query and provide your response.`;

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  try {
    const stream = await streamText({
      model,
      messages,
      system: systemPrompt,
      tools: {
        getFormattedProjects: tool({
          description: 'Get a concise text summary of all portfolio projects',
          parameters: z.object({}),
          execute: async () => {
            try {
              const formattedProjects = await getFormattedProjects();
              return { summary: formattedProjects };
            } catch (error) {
              console.error('Error fetching formatted projects:', error);
              throw new Error('Failed to fetch formatted projects');
            }
          },
        }),
